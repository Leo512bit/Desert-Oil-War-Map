# Desert-Oil-War-Map
A large modmap for Openra

To "build" it from "source" download the files as .ZIP and delete the README.MD file and rename the file extension to .oramap and place the file into :
C:\Users\YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\OpenRA\maps\ra\release-XXXXXXXX OR playtest-XXXXXXXX OR {DEV_VERSION}

The map is also on https://resource.openra.net/maps/40146/

Have fun on this map :)
